Check line of sight using raycasting

rig for smooth animation and target tracking

rigid body + collider for enemy maybe simpler collider for main character

Mon:
Enemy controller
self controller
bullet time
intergration with gun system 

After Monday:
So basically wasted time doing publisher system for slow mo.
ideas: Instead of slowing different objects by different factor, simply give main character a little speed boost during slow mo time, 
should make everything else much easier.

Tues:
Health, Stamina, Map (maybe just use free assets at this point) Write Doc
Game logic (including UI, menu, ending)
Levels can use publisher system (but really just need change player's script)
Test play and levels (difficulties)
